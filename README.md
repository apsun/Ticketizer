This is Ticketizer, a work-in-progress to let you buy 
tickets from China's 12306.cn website with using a 
fraction of the time and effort that would be required 
to use their actual crappy website.

P.S. Maybe 12306's programmers could learn a thing or two 
by looking at how many hacks I have to use in my code in 
order to get everything to work...
